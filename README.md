San Francisco Crime Classification
Overview

This project aims to build a model that classifies various types of crimes in San Francisco based on historical data. The model is designed to assist law enforcement and public safety agencies in identifying and predicting crime patterns, which can help in resource allocation and crime prevention strategies.
Project Structure

    Data: The dataset used for this project includes features like the time, location, and type of crime, along with other relevant details. The data is preprocessed to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and normalize numerical features.

    Modeling: The project involves applying several machine learning algorithms to classify crimes into different categories. The performance of these models is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

    Evaluation: The results are analyzed to understand the strengths and weaknesses of each model. The final model is selected based on its overall performance and ability to generalize to unseen data.

Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure that the following libraries are installed:

    pandas
    numpy
    scikit-learn
    matplotlib
    seaborn

You can install the required libraries using pip:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

    Data Preparation: Load and preprocess the dataset to handle any missing values and prepare it for model training.

    Model Training: Train the machine learning models using the preprocessed data and evaluate their performance.

    Prediction: Use the trained model to predict crime types on new data.

    Evaluation: Analyze the modelâ€™s performance on the test data and refine it as necessary.

Conclusion

This project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques to the classification of crimes in a metropolitan area. By understanding the patterns in historical crime data, the project contributes to public safety efforts by providing insights that can be used for better decision-making and resource allocation.
Future Work

    Feature Engineering: Explore additional features that could improve model accuracy.

    Advanced Models: Experiment with more complex models, such as ensemble methods or deep learning techniques.

    Deployment: Deploy the model as a web service or integrate it into an existing crime analytics platform.
